## Problem Title
##  SIH 1555: Create a Virtual Herbal Garden that provides an interactive, educational, and immersive experience to users, showcasing the diverse range of medicinal plants used in AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy).

## Problem Description
### Background: 
The AYUSH sector relies significantly on medicinal plants and herbs, which are fundamental to traditional systems of healing. However, physical herbal gardens are often inaccessible to many individuals due to geographical and physical constraints. A Virtual Herbal Garden offers a solution to this problem by providing a digital space where users can explore and learn about the importance and benefits of various medicinal plants from the convenience of their homes.

### Description: 
The objective is to develop a Virtual Herbal Garden that is user-friendly, informative, and engaging. This digital platform should include several features to ensure a comprehensive experience. It must have interactive 3D models of medicinal plants, allowing users to rotate, zoom, and examine them from various angles. Each plant should be accompanied by detailed information, including its botanical and common names, habitat, medicinal applications, and cultivation techniques. The platform should incorporate multimedia elements such as high-quality images, educational videos, and audio guides to enrich the user experience. A robust search and filter system should help users quickly find plants based on specific criteria such as medicinal uses, regions, or plant types. Additionally, the platform should offer guided virtual tours organized by themes like digestive health, immunity, and skincare. Features enabling users to bookmark favorite plants, take personal notes, and share information on social media are also encouraged.

### Expected Outcome: 
The expected result is a comprehensive, visually attractive Virtual Herbal Garden that can serve as a powerful educational tool. It should cater to students, AYUSH practitioners, educators, and individuals interested in natural healing. The platform should successfully merge traditional herbal knowledge with modern technology, making it accessible and engaging for a wide range of users.

## Problem Creater's Organization
This problem statement has been introduced by the Ministry of AYUSH, which focuses on promoting traditional Indian systems of medicine and ensuring their widespread adoption through innovative solutions.

### Idea
The central idea is to create a digital replica of a herbal garden that is interactive and educational. Through the use of 3D models, multimedia content, and guided virtual experiences, the platform will enable users to explore medicinal plants used in the AYUSH systems. The goal is to present traditional knowledge in a modern, accessible format that can be appreciated by both specialists and the general public.

### Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
To enhance accessibility to the knowledge of medicinal plants, we propose the development of V-Herbal Garden, a web-based platform that simulates the experience of exploring a real herbal garden. The platform will feature lifelike 3D models of medicinal plants, which users can interact with by rotating and zooming. Each plant will be enriched with detailed descriptions, including names, natural habitats, medicinal benefits, and cultivation methods. Multimedia components such as images, videos, and audio in regional languages will be used to deliver content effectively. Users will be able to search and filter plants based on medicinal uses, locations, or types, and take part in themed virtual tours on topics such as immunity and skincare. Additional features like bookmarking, personal notes, and social media sharing will personalize the user experience. The application will be built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage.

### Use Cases
The Virtual Herbal Garden will serve multiple user groups. Students and researchers in the field of traditional medicine can use it as an academic reference to study plant properties and applications. Practitioners and enthusiasts of Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy can rely on the platform to explore medicinal uses and cultivation methods. Educators can use the platform as a teaching tool, enhancing lessons through virtual tours and multimedia content. General users interested in home remedies and natural wellness can explore plants based on specific health concerns such as immunity or digestion. Additionally, the platform can assist in government-led campaigns to promote AYUSH practices and increase public awareness of traditional medicinal systems.
