## Problem Title
SIH 1555: Create a Virtual Herbal Garden that provides an interactive, educational, and immersive experience to users, showcasing the diverse range of medicinal plants used in AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy).
## Problem Description
Background: The AYUSH sector relies heavily on medicinal plants and herbs, which form the backbone of traditional healing practices. However, physical gardens that are not accessible to everyone. A Virtual Herbal Garden will bridge this gap by offering a digital platform where users can explore, learn, and understand the significance of various medicinal plants from the comfort of their homes. Description: Participants are tasked with developing a Virtual Herbal Garden that is engaging, informative, and user-friendly. This virtual garden should include: Interactive 3D Models: Realistic 3D models of medicinal plants that users can rotate, zoom, and explore from different angles. Detailed Information: Comprehensive details about each plant, including its botanical name, common names, habitat, medicinal uses, and methods of cultivation. Multimedia Integration: High-quality images, videos, and audio descriptions to enhance the learning experience. Search and Filter Options: Advanced search functionality to easily locate specific plants and filter them based on various criteria like medicinal uses, region, and type. Virtual Tours: Guided virtual tours highlighting specific themes, such as plants for digestive health, immunity, skin care, etc. User Interaction: Features that allow users to bookmark favourite plants, take notes, and share information on social media. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is a comprehensive Virtual Herbal Garden that serves as a valuable educational tool for students, practitioners, and enthusiasts of the AYUSH sector. This platform should make the knowledge of medicinal plants accessible to a wider audience, promoting awareness and understanding of traditional herbal practices. It should be visually appealing, informative, and interactive, providing users with an immersive experience that combines technology with traditional knowledge.

## Idea
The idea is to create an interactive digital platform that simulates a real herbal garden, allowing users to explore medicinal plants used in AYUSH systems through 3D models, multimedia content, and virtual tours. It aims to make traditional herbal knowledge easily accessible, engaging, and educational for a wider audience.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
To make medicinal plant knowledge accessible to all, we propose V-Herbal Garden, a web-based platform that offers an interactive and educational experience of a real herbal garden. The platform will feature realistic 3D models of medicinal plants used in AYUSH systems, allowing users to rotate and explore each plant from different angles. Each plant will include detailed information such as botanical and common names, habitat, medicinal uses, and cultivation methods. High-quality images, videos, and audio descriptions in regional languages will enrich the learning experience. Users can search and filter plants based on use, region, or type and take themed virtual tours (e.g., for immunity or skincare). The platform also includes features like bookmarks, personal notes, and social media sharing. Built with React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, this immersive garden will bridge the gap between traditional plant knowledge and modern digital accessibility.

## Use Cases
The Virtual Herbal Garden can be used by a variety of audiences. Students and researchers in the field of traditional medicine can explore plant information for academic purposes. Practitioners and enthusiasts of Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy can use it to understand medicinal uses and cultivation methods. Educators can use the platform as a teaching tool through guided virtual tours and multimedia. General users interested in natural remedies can search for plants based on health needs like immunity or digestion. Additionally, the platform can support government awareness campaigns and promote AYUSH practices digitally.
